# Network-Projects
This repository contains a collection of networking configuration projects developed during my internship, focused on various aspects of network design, security, routing, and switching.
The projects include configurations for access control lists (ACLs), DHCP, static and dynamic routing, inter-VLAN communication, firewall setups, port security, and more, all created using Cisco Packet Tracer. 
The projects cover the configuration of multiple routers, switches, and firewalls to create secure and efficient network infrastructures.

Projects Included:

Access Control Lists (ACLs): Extended and standard ACL configurations.

Routing: Dynamic routing using RIP and EIGRP, along with static routing for different network setups.

DHCP: Configurations for DHCP snooping and server-router communication.

Firewalls: Various firewall configurations including NAT, ACL, and inter-network communication security.

Switching: VLAN setup and inter-VLAN routing on multilayer switches, along with port security.

Additional Projects: Static NAT, subnetting, and device connectivity configurations.

Each folder represents a unique network configuration or project, and the configurations have been tested and optimized for various network scenarios.
